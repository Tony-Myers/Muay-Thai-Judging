      <h1>“A running race”: why the whole-fight narrative matters</h1>
      <p class="lead">Thai officials often explain Muay Thai scoring using a “running race” analogy: the lead can change, and a decisive round can outweigh earlier small advantages. The practical aim is to track who is ahead overall, based on effect, balance and control.</p>

      <h2>Where the analogy comes from</h2>
      <p class="muted">In this training material the analogy is attributed to senior Thai officials including Radom Na Bangchang (Technical Director and referee at Lumpinee Boxing Stadium) and Wan Chai (referee at Rajadamnern Boxing Stadium). The message is simple: do not treat the bout as five separate, disconnected mini-fights.</p>

      <h2>What the analogy helps you do</h2>
      <ul class="muted">
        <li><strong>Avoid false “round resets”:</strong> small early edges do not automatically disappear if the other boxer produces a clear, decisive round later.</li>
        <li><strong>Explain lead changes:</strong> if one boxer clearly takes control (effect, posture breaks, dominance), they can take the overall lead even if they were behind earlier.</li>
        <li><strong>Use 10-point must as a record:</strong> you are recording who is ahead on the criteria, not counting touches.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="notice small">
        <strong>After each round:</strong> ask “Who is ahead now, and why?” Use the <a href="scoring-hierarchy.html">scoring hierarchy</a> to justify your answer.
      </div>

      <h2>Why this is compatible with 10-point must</h2>
      <p class="muted">A 10-point must card gives a structured record. The judgement still comes from Muay Thai criteria: effect and dominance first, then balance, then clean scoring, clinch control, and defence/counters. If a round is genuinely decisive, it should be recorded as such (for example 10–8 for a knockdown or sustained domination).</p>

      <h2>Worked examples</h2>
      <p class="muted">For worked examples of how to record an early lead, a lead change, and a final-round comeback that is not enough to overturn the lead, see the two example scorecards on the <a href="scorecards.html">Scorecards</a> page.</p>

      <details style="margin-top:16px">
        <summary class="focus-ring">Note on “similar systems”</summary>
        <div class="small muted" style="padding:8px 4px 0">
          Other combat sports have also used “whole contest” approaches. For example, older forms of amateur boxing (including some electronic scoring eras) and the original intent of professional boxing’s 10-point must system were aimed at avoiding a simple “count the touches” mindset. Muay Thai’s judging criteria make the same point in Muay Thai terms: effect, balance and control.
