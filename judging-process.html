      <h1>How judges compare boxers</h1>
      <p class="lead">A judge is comparing two boxers across the whole fight, focusing on effectiveness, dominance, balance, defence and the developing narrative.</p>

      <h2>What judges can see (because they cannot feel impact)</h2>
      <p class="muted">Judges use visual clues to infer effect. Key cues include:</p>
      <ul class="muted">
        <li><strong>Target:</strong> techniques landing cleanly on scoring targets.</li>
        <li><strong>Aesthetics:</strong> good Muay Thai balance before, during and after delivery; sharp clean weapons.</li>
        <li><strong>Balance:</strong> does a boxer get moved by the opponent’s technique?</li>
        <li><strong>Condition:</strong> fatigue shown through loss of position and inability to maintain stance (often interpreted retrospectively as cumulative effect).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Comparing the quality of delivery</h2>
      <ul class="muted">
        <li>Appropriate technique at the right distance.</li>
        <li>Delivered on balance; returns to stance.</li>
        <li>Effective: produces displacement, posture change, or behavioural change.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Styles that can win (when they create effect)</h2>
      <ul class="muted">
        <li>The composed kicker controlling range.</li>
        <li>The clinch controller turning, kneeing and breaking posture.</li>
        <li>The counter fighter who scores cleaner and looks dominant.</li>
        <li>The puncher, when punches create unmistakable effect (knockdowns, visible damage, sustained dominance).</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="notice small">
        <strong>Strength can be shown without “big attacks”.</strong> For example: blocking every technique; resisting throws when a leg is caught; or maintaining posture in clinch while the opponent is pulled down and weakened.
      </div>

      <h2>Sharpness and control within an exchange</h2>
      <p class="muted">If both boxers perform similar actions, the sharper, faster and cleaner execution typically reads as stronger (for example, catching a kick and returning a quick, clean kick-over versus a slower, less controlled sequence).</p>

      <details style="margin-top:16px">
        <summary class="focus-ring">A note on “aggression”</summary>
        <div class="small muted" style="padding:8px 4px 0">
          Aggression is only meaningful when it is effective. The training material includes a boxing-derived slide to illustrate that clean, powerful, accurate scoring can occur while moving in any direction and even while counter fighting. In Muay Thai terms, prioritise effect, balance and control over forward motion.
