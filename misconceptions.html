      <h1>Misconceptions and common errors</h1>
      <p class="lead">Traditional Thai scoring can feel unfamiliar if you come from “count the strikes” systems. This page highlights common misconceptions and replaces them with clear, judge-facing criteria.</p>
      
      <h2>1) “Aggression means walking forward”</h2>
      <p class="muted">In traditional judging, <strong>direction is neutral</strong>. A boxer can score moving forward, moving back, moving sideways, or with their back to the ropes. What matters is <strong>effective scoring with balance and control</strong>, not simple forward motion.</p>
      <div class="notice small">
        <strong>Practical test:</strong> if the “pressure” is neutralised or easily evaded, it is usually a weak signal unless the fight is otherwise extremely close.
      </div>

      <h2>2) “High activity wins rounds”</h2>
      <p class="muted">Busy hands, many touches, or constant forward movement can look impressive, but they only score strongly when they create <strong>visible effect</strong> (hurt, displacement, posture break, behavioural change) or clear dominance.</p>
      <ul class="muted">
        <li><strong>Strong signals (often decisive):</strong> displacement or posture break; clear visible hurt or change in behaviour; clean body kick or knee delivered with balance (and not convincingly returned).</li>
        <li><strong>Weak signals (only matter in close fights):</strong> high activity with little effect; pressure that is neutralised or easily evaded; contact that is clearly absorbed/checked with posture unaffected.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3) “Every kick scores the same”</h2>
      <p class="muted">Judges prioritise <strong>clean scoring weapons on scoring targets</strong> delivered with balance and effect. A kick that lands on arms, is clearly checked, or does not move or affect the opponent is typically low value. Clean body kicks and knees rise when they show effect and the scorer remains composed.</p>

      <h2>4) “Catching a kick automatically scores”</h2>
      <p class="muted">A catch can reduce the opponent’s score. What separates the exchange is what happens next: a fast, sharp, balanced response that clearly changes the opponent’s position or posture scores better than a slow, messy return.</p>
      <ul class="muted">
        <li>If both fighters catch and return, the quicker, sharper, cleaner action tends to be judged stronger.</li>
        <li>Control and balance after the exchange matter: who stays composed and who is disrupted?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5) “Muay Thai is scored as isolated rounds”</h2>
      <p class="muted">The 10-point must card is a recording tool. Traditional Thai judging often explains the bout as a developing narrative: leads can change, and a decisive round can outweigh several earlier “small edges”.</p>
      <p class="muted">Use the <a href="running-race.html">running race analogy</a> and the <a href="scorecards.html">scorecard guidance</a> to practise describing who is ahead overall and why.</p>

      <h2>6) “You can add up points per strike”</h2>
      <p class="muted">It is tempting to assign fixed points to different weapons. In practice, scoring depends on <strong>relative effect</strong>, <strong>sharpness</strong>, and <strong>how the action changes the opponent</strong>. A “points” mental model can be a rough self-check when all else is genuinely equal, but it is not how bouts are judged.</p>

      <details style="margin-top:16px">
        <summary class="focus-ring">A rough self-check some fighters use (not a judging rule)</summary>
        <div class="small muted" style="padding:8px 4px 0">
          One top stadium fighter’s personal “rough guide” for monitoring his own fights (only when other factors are equal) was: punch (1), leg kick (1), round knee (2), body kick (3), straight knee (3). The key point is the warning: real judging depends on effect, sharpness and control.
